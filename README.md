# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-SQL

In this project, we will explore a dataset using SQL to perform exploratory data analysis. Exploratory data analysis is the process of analyzing and summarizing data in order to gain insights and identify patterns. We will use SQL queries to perform a range of analysis, including data aggregation, filtering, sorting, and data visualization.

Dataset:

For this project, we will use Maven Marketing dataset. The dataset includes customer information, such as income, educaion, marital status and and order details such as marketing campaign, channels of purchase and complains.

Goals:

The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior, product sales and successful campaigns by exploring the dataset using SQL. Specifically, we will aim to answer the following questions:

* What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?

* Which marketing campaign was the most successful?

* Which products are performing best?

* Which channels are underperforming?

* What does the average customer look like?
